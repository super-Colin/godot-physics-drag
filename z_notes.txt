One year to discover the Higgs Boson before funding is shut down in 1 year
- 1 try per week, 52 weeks
- -- some weeks will be maintainance and not get to perform a particle launch (cost money, but gain strength, _and_ recharge/gain money from excess from constant energy sources)


[] make it clear that the mouse being further from the particle doesn't drag it more strongly


Heavier atoms "jerk" more, making them harder to hit?





3 time slots per week
- potentially 3 experiments per week


You make money off of the energy you produce
- you start with a small solar farm, which supplies a small amount every week
- Excess is sold off automatically
You are expected to maintain a minimun energy output as you progress (city contracts?)


Experiments cost energy to perform
- heavier particles require more energy input
- -- ? energy drains while dragging the particle?

Upgrades cost money, produced by selling surplus energy
- Battery (energy storage max)
- Coils (mouse pull strength)
- Solar (more energy income)

Modifiers
- Quark - adds random impulses to the atom, adds extra energy to the collision
